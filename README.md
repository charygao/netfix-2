## Future Feature and Implementation

  - Reviewing Videos

   Netflix, though it may not be apparent, allows users review videos. I plan on implementing this feature by adding a dropdown menu that    includes a review form, which creates a review when submitted. I will also have other users' reviews on that menu, and allow for a user    to delete their own reviews.

  - Search Feature

  - Search Feature

   Netflix has a search feature that shows all videos that relate to your search on every key stroke. I plan to implement this using an OnChange event handler that will render a page of videos whose title includes the letters entered into the input field.
